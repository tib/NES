# SwiftNES

This repo contains all the source code for my experimental [100 days of NES](https://twitter.com/search?q=100daysOfNES&src=typed_query) challenge.

## What is this all about?

I'm planning to build a fully working NES emulator in a 100 days. 

But Why? ü§î 

I just want learn more about low level hardware devices (CPU, memory, etc.) asm code, Swift and computers in general.

Wish me luck and feel free to start discussions, raise issues & PRs. üçÄ

FYI: The challenge started on the 8th of September 2021.
